             <p>Hello! My name is Anakin Tellez and i am from MÃ©xico. I enjoy play basquetbol and build furniture, is my first time studing programming and im so excited to learn all this topics, 
                I am 22 years old, I am a carpenter because I really like making furniture and working with wood. I also consider it as a way to get rid of the stress that I have during the week so it is a good way to relax, I can say that my favorite book of the Book of Mormon is Moshia. I feel that it transmits many truths of many principles and that it is a book that has helped me strengthen my testimony, reading that book is a good way to continue growing in temporal and spiritual aspects, it has advice and ideas that we can use day by day in our lives to be better people, it is or more or less is what would be part of who I am, I love to always be taking advantage of the time of my day whether at work, at church and why not Well, sometimes you have fun with family or friends, but the idea is to be able to do something with the time we have on this earth, one of the phrases that I really like is "embrace the light while it shines" I know that our time on this earth is limited but that does not mean that the light will disappear, I just know that that is why we have this time here to be able to learn and develop gifts and talents. 
                That is the reason why I like to continue learning new things, that is why I wanted to try to study programming to continue developing talents, it has been a difficult path because it is the first time I entered this world, but the truth is that when you dedicate yourself time in this you manage to understand the topics and sometimes it is difficult but when you get help from the instructors it is easier, I will continue learning and strengthening all the skills that I already have that I will have.</p>
            <p>And this is me</p>
